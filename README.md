### City-of-Westminster-Food-Hygiene-Rating-Analysis

Hello and thank you for checking out my project :)
<br>My inspiration for this project was from this article I came across earlier https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mcdonalds-mouse-droppings-leytonstone-fine-b2331741.html
<br>I decided to utilise SQL to analyse the hygiene situation of food outlets in the City of Westminster, the area with the most food outlets in London.
